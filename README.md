Concept: Website allow users to search for a pokemon, which will call the pokedex API and return the pokemon's data. A battle button will appear
which will go to another webpage and allow the user to battle a random pokemon. Seperate pages allows a user to see pokemons wins and losses and
create a random team of 6 pokemon.
